Tutor: A simple way to connect tutors and tutees here at Cornell University

The purpose of our app, Tutor, is to make connecting tutors and tutees on campus as easy as possible. Many students seek extra help in certain classes and would like fellow students to help them out. Other students, who excel in these same classes, are looking for a way to make money and assist those in need. This app allows students to find each other and create that first connection. 

When opening up the app for the first time, the student is prompted to sign in via their NetID gmail account. After selecting various preferences, the user is then offered the option of being a tutor, tutee or both. Following this, the user inputs personal information for their profile, which includes graduation year, major and a short description about themselves. 

After the initial set up, we accessed all of Cornell undergraduate courses via the course API. The user has the ability to search for and select as many courses as they desire. They then can browse through either the tutors or tutees of selected class. They can then add the tutor/tutee of their choice to save their profile information. This is the start of their connection.

Tutor has a very intuitive and simple interface. The colors are chosen by the user to enhance user experience. Using Cornell email addresses for signing in ensures that every user has a unique identification. 

iOS: Various ViewControllers with Navigation through the app. 
Backend: Google API, cornell course API
